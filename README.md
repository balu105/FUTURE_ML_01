# Classify Spotify Songs by Mood

## Overview

This project aims to build a classification model that categorizes Spotify songs into different mood categories (such as happy, sad, energetic, etc.) based on audio features. By analyzing the features of songs, the model will predict the mood of each song. The project also includes a visualization of mood distributions across playlists.

## Skills Learned

- **Classification**: Learn how to build a classification model to categorize songs into different moods.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle and process audio data, clean and prepare it for machine learning.
- **Audio Feature Analysis**: Extract and analyze audio features using libraries like Librosa to understand the mood of a song.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used to build and train the model.
- **Librosa**: A Python library used for audio analysis and feature extraction from the songs.
- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library used to build the classification model and evaluate its performance.
- **Matplotlib**: A library for visualizing the distribution of song moods and other important data insights.

## Dataset

- **Spotify Song Dataset**: This dataset contains a variety of songs from Spotify, including audio features such as tempo, energy, valence, and more, along with the mood labels (e.g., happy, sad, energetic).

## Deliverables

1. **Classification Model**: A machine learning model that can classify songs into different mood categories based on their audio features.
2. **Mood Distribution Visualization**: A visualization showing the distribution of moods across different playlists or song sets.
3. **Report**: A brief report summarizing the model performance, mood classification accuracy, and insights into the most important audio features influencing mood.

## Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Extract audio features from the songs using Librosa (such as tempo, energy, spectral features, etc.).
   - Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and normalize/scale the audio features to ensure the model performs well.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new features or modify existing ones to improve the classification modelâ€™s performance.
   - Visualize the distribution of features to better understand patterns that may correlate with moods.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Train a classification model using algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), or Logistic Regression to predict the mood of each song.
   - Split the dataset into training and test sets and evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assess the classification model with a confusion matrix and classification report to understand how well it identifies the correct moods.
   - Evaluate the model on various mood categories and interpret the results.

5. **Mood Distribution Visualization**:
   - Create visualizations (e.g., bar charts or pie charts) to show how different moods are distributed across songs in playlists.
   - Use Matplotlib to generate these plots and provide insights into the mood patterns in the dataset.

6. **Report**:
   - Write a summary of the findings, including an explanation of the most important audio features influencing the classification, model performance, and the distribution of moods.
